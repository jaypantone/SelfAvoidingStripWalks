# SelfAvoidingStripWalks

This repository contains Python code to generate finite state machines to count various
kinds of self-avoiding walks in a half-infinite strip. It relies on the
`finite_state_machines` package (https://pypi.org/project/finite-state-machines/) that
can be installed with pip!
